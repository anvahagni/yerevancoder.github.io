If we emitted objects with type tags, ProtoBuf.js would\r\n * choke claiming that the tags aren't fields in the Message.\r\n *\r\n * Allowing both formats here makes the serializer able to consume the outputs\r\n * it produces: for all messages it supports, fromX(toX(value)) == value.\r\n *\r\n * Note that case 2 suffers from ambiguity: if multiple tags are present\r\n * without a type tag then the callers are structured in such a way that the\r\n * first invocation will win. Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\r\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\r\n * solution.\r\n *\r\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\r\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\r\n * default value for the type.

Data is stored persistently\r\n * across sessions.\r\n *\r\n * Currently the Firestore SDK only supports a single consumer of the database,\r\n * but browsers obviously support multiple tabs. IndexedDbPersistence ensures a\r\n * single consumer of the database via an \"owner lease\" stored in the database.\r\n *\r\n * On startup, IndexedDbPersistence assigns itself a random \"ownerId\" and writes\r\n * it to a special \"owner\" object in the database (if no entry exists already or\r\n * the current entry is expired). This owner lease is then verified inside every\r\n * transaction to ensure the lease has not been lost.\r\n *\r\n * If a tab opts not to acquire the owner lease (because there's an existing\r\n * non-expired owner) or loses the owner lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a\r\n * failed state and all subsequent operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * The current owner regularly refreshes the owner lease with new timestamps to\r\n * prevent newly-opened tabs from taking over ownership.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the owner\r\n * lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make sure that\r\n * a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the owner lease).\r\n * Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload since it is\r\n * an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the lease,\r\n * the owner writes its ownerId to a \"zombiedOwnerId\" entry in LocalStorage\r\n * which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and take the\r\n * owner lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n */\r\nvar IndexedDbPersistence = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function IndexedDbPersistence(prefix, serializer) {\r\n        this.ownerId = this.generateOwnerId();\r\n        this.dbName = prefix + IndexedDbPersistence.MAIN_DATABASE;\r\n        this.serializer = new LocalSerializer(serializer);\r\n        this.localStoragePrefix = prefix;\r\n    }\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.start = function () {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        if (!IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable()) {\r\n            this.persistenceError = new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR_MSG);\r\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\r\n        }\r\n        assert(!this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence double-started!');\r\n        this.started = true;\r\n        return SimpleDb.openOrCreate(this.dbName, SCHEMA_VERSION, createOrUpgradeDb)\r\n            .then(function (db) {\r\n            _this.simpleDb = db;\r\n        })\r\n            .then(function () { return _this.tryAcquireOwnerLease(); })\r\n            .then(function () {\r\n            _this.scheduleOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\r\n            _this.attachWindowUnloadHook();\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.shutdown = function (deleteData) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        assert(this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence shutdown without start!');\r\n        this.started = false;\r\n        this.detachWindowUnloadHook();\r\n        this.stopOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\r\n        return this.releaseOwnerLease().then(function () {\r\n            _this.simpleDb.close();\r\n            if (deleteData) {\r\n                return SimpleDb.delete(_this.dbName);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getMutationQueue = function (user) {\r\n        return IndexedDbMutationQueue.forUser(user, this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getQueryCache = function () {\r\n        return new IndexedDbQueryCache(this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getRemoteDocumentCache = function () {\r\n        return new IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache(this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.runTransaction = function (action, operation) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        if (this.persistenceError) {\r\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\r\n        }\r\n        debug(LOG_TAG$3, 'Starting transaction:', action);\r\n        // Do all transactions as readwrite against all object stores, since we\r\n        // are the only reader/writer.\r\n        return this.simpleDb.runTransaction('readwrite', ALL_STORES, function (txn) {\r\n            // Verify that we still have the owner lease as part of every transaction.\r\n            return _this.ensureOwnerLease(txn).next(function () { return operation(txn); });\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable = function () {\r\n        return SimpleDb.isAvailable();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\r\n     * LocalStorage.\r\n     */\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.buildStoragePrefix = function (databaseInfo) {\r\n        // Use two different prefix formats:\r\n        //\r\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\r\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\r\n        //\r\n        // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\r\n        // so there's no danger of collisions.\r\n        var database = databaseInfo.databaseId.projectId;\r\n        if (!databaseInfo.databaseId.isDefaultDatabase) {\r\n            database += '.' + databaseInfo.databaseId.database;\r\n        }\r\n        return 'firestore/' + databaseInfo.persistenceKey + '/' + database + '/';\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Acquires the owner lease if there's no valid owner.
